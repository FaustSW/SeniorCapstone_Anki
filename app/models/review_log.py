Database Model: ReviewLog

A single review event, recorded for stats and auditing.

Fields:
    id          - primary key
    user_id     - foreign key to User
    card_id     - foreign key to Card
    vocab_id    - foreign key to Vocab (denormalized for easier stats queries)
    rating      - user rating value (1=Again, 2=Hard, 3=Good, 4=Easy)
    reviewed_at - timestamp of when the review happened (UTC)

This table does not affect scheduling. The scheduler only reads/writes
the Card model. ReviewLog is append-only, review_service creates entries,
stats_service reads them for metrics.

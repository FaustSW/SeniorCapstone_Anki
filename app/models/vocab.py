Database Model: Vocab

A single Spanish vocabulary item from the seeded dataset.
This is global content — shared across all users, not user-specific.

Fields:
    id           — primary key
    term         — Spanish word or phrase (e.g., "ser"), unique
    english_gloss — short English meaning (e.g., "to be")
    intro_index  — position in the learning sequence, unique

User-specific learning state lives in Card, not here.
Table name is "vocab" to match Card's foreign_key="vocab.id".

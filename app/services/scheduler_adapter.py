scheduler_adapter.py

Translation layer between our Card model and the anki-sm-2 library.

Architecture:
    review_service -> scheduler_adapter -> SM-2 library (black box)

Responsibilities:
    - Translate Card scheduling fields <-> SM2Card
    - Pass rating through the scheduler
    - Apply updated SM-2 values back onto Card (mutate in place)
    - Return the Card (caller persists)
